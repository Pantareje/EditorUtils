# Editor Utils

A collection of utilities for use in the editor. The features are minimal and heterogeneous, as they mainly consist of simple generic tools I had to code for myself when developing my own projects.

## Features

### Screenshot Taker

A simple popup window with a button to take a screenshot of the running game. It saves the screenshots to the `Screenshots` folder in the project root.

### Take Screenshot

A menu button that directly takes a screenshot of the game, without displaying any window. It can also be run with `Ctrl + Alt + S`.
